I built this app years ago to help us decide on a new city. It fetches and scrapes data from [Best Places](https://www.bestplaces.net/) and [Area Vibes](https://www.areavibes.com/) and then displays it in a simplified format.

The app is no longer functional, but I have left it up for posterity and made it work with Austin, TX.

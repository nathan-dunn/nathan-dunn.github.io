Online version of my resume I made to stand-out. It's handy and responsive, but when converting it to pdf the document is not scannable by ATS software!

I have since made a [pdf version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11cQryoLjXg8iPJBjnc_TGFmtXKtlDli6/view?usp=drive_link) that is scannable, but left this site up to show my work.

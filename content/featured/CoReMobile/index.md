The CoRe App is a native iOS based app that allows CoRe App system users to decode VINs, input detailed vehicle information, take photos and write a basic or detailed condition report that is customizable for each consignor.

CoRe functionality was recently incorporated into both Marketplace Web and Marketplace Mobile products.
